# Altimeter cold temperature corrector
When air is colder, the altimeter will show a higher altitude than in reality. Therefore, the airplane would fly too low.   

This application will determine the required correction and required altitude to be flown in order to compensate for the error caused by a colder temperature.
Designed for flight simulation use.
